# Overview
The purpose of this computer exercise was to utulize assembly language programing to solve 3 problems involving memory manipulation, mathematics, and looping. The programming format was designed to work on the PRISM operating system. Below are descriptions of the problems and the opcodes/operands used to solve them.

# Part A
In part A the goal was to write a program that stores the value $9 in location $B0, $8 in $C4 and $B in $CB. This was implemented using the Mnemonic LDAI (loads the operand into the accumulator), STA (stores the value in the accumulator in a position given by the operand), and JMP (used to loop through the program to prevent it from crashing.
